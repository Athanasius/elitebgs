            <strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
            privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the
            United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable
            Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly
            the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more

            According to CalOPPA, I agree to the following: Users can visit my site anonymously. Once this privacy
            policy is created, I will add a link to it on my home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page
            after entering my website. My Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on
            the page specified above.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on my Privacy Policy Page.

            You can change your personal information by chatting with me through connected Discord account in the
            dedicated Discord server or by sending me an email. You can also delete any information from the system
            using the online portal.

            <strong>Does my site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            It's also important to note that I do not allow third-party behavioral tracking

            <strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the
            Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,
            United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of
            websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
